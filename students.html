									Dr. Bo Liu is a Senior Research Associate at Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science Department, University of Pittsburgh. He received his dual B.S. degree in Optical Engineering from Huazhong University of Science and Technology and mechanical engineering from Wuhan University of Technology (2007). He earned M.S. in electromechanical engineering from the Wuhan University of Technology (2010) and the Ph.D. in electrical and computer engineering at Virginia Tech (2016). After his graduation, Dr. Liu joined National Energy Technology Laboratory as a Research Engineer for 4 years. He is the inventor of Distributed Temperature Sensing technique using single crystal fiber. And he is the primary designer of over three sets of Laser Heated Pedestal Growth system at Virginia Tech, NETL, and Pitt. His awards include Recipient of Carnegie Science Awards in the Innovation in Energy (2020) and Finalist of William M. Steen Award (2019) (National Energy Technology Laboratory, NETL DOE). He is the review panel for DOE SBIR and editor for journal MDPI. Dr. Liu’s research interest focuses on fabrication and sensing application of single crystal fiber.

								<h3>Pengdi Zhang</h3>
								<br>								
								<i class="fa fa-envelope fa-lg"></i> <a href="mailto: pez37@pitt.edu"><span>pez37@pitt.edu</span></a>
								<p>
									Pengdi received his B.S. in Energy and Power Engineering from the University of Shanghai for Science and Technology. Before transferring to the Ph.D. position in Prof.Paul's Group, his research interest lies within the area of combining machine learning with fluid mechanics prediction during the M.S. program in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Pittsburgh. He believes that the application of machine learning algorithms will bring a research efficiency boost to traditional fields. The next research direction for him is the combination of ML and structural-acoustic detection. During leisure time, he enjoys film and swimming.
