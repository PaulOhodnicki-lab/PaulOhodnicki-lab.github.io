								<p>
									Dr. Liu was a Senior Research Associate here at the Ohodnicki Lab, MEMS, Pitt. He received his dual B.S. degree in Optical Engineering from Huazhong University of Science and Technology and Mechanical Engineering from Wuhan University of Technology. He earned M.S. in Electromechanical Engineering from Wuhan University of Technology and Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Virginia Tech. During his 4 years at NETL, he became the inventor of Distributed Temperature Sensing technique using single crystal fibers. And he was the primary designer of over three sets of LHPG system at Virginia Tech, NETL, and Pitt. He was the recipient of Carnegie Science Awards in the Innovation in Energy (2020) and Finalist of William M. Steen Award (2019) (NETL, DOE). He is also the review panel for DOE SBIR and editor for journal MDPI. He is now a Principal Investigator at Zhejiang Lab, one of the top research labs in China.
